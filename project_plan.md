- [x] Document deployment process and requirements

## 9. Final Testing and Launch
- [ ] Perform final round of testing on the production environment
  - [ ] Run production test script
  - [ ] Manually test all features in the production setup
  - [ ] Verify SSL certificate is working correctly
  - [ ] Ensure WebSocket connections are secure
  - [ ] Test LiveKit voice functionality in production
- [ ] Address any last-minute issues or bugs
- [ ] Launch application

## Next Steps
1. Execute final round of testing using the production test script and manual testing
2. Address any issues discovered during final testing
3. Prepare launch announcement and marketing materials
4. Set up monitoring and logging for the production environment
5. Create a backup and disaster recovery plan
6. Launch the application
7. Monitor the application post-launch for any issues
8. Gather user feedback and plan for future improvements
