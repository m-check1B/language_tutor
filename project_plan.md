## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of text and voice chatbot functionality
2. Conduct thorough testing of all new features in the containerized environment
3. Prepare for production deployment with enhanced security measures
4. Complete developer documentation and deployment process documentation
5. Plan for monitoring and logging in the containerized environment, including auth, payment-related events, and chatbot interactions
6. Conduct final security checks and performance optimizations
7. Prepare for user training and support during the transition to the new system

Note: The application now includes external authentication and paywall features, internationalization support for EN, CS, and ES languages, Tailwind CSS styling, dark mode functionality, and text/voice chatbot capabilities. The frontend runs on port 3081, the backend on port 8081, and the database on port 5432. This setup should be considered when performing tests and maintenance. Special attention should be given to securing sensitive information, ensuring proper access control, maintaining consistent styling and translations across all supported languages and themes, and optimizing the performance of real-time text and voice interactions.
