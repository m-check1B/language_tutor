# Language Tutor Application Project Plan

[Previous content remains unchanged]

## 11. Containerization
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml to include database, backend, and frontend services
- [x] Update backend Dockerfile
- [x] Update frontend Dockerfile

## 12. Testing Containerized Application
- [ ] Build and run the containerized application
- [ ] Test database connection from the backend container
- [ ] Test API endpoints from the frontend container
- [ ] Verify WebSocket functionality in the containerized environment
- [ ] Test LiveKit integration in the containerized setup

## 13. Production Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for the containerized application
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates for secure communication
- [ ] Create a production docker-compose file if necessary

## 14. Final Testing and Launch
- [ ] Perform final round of testing on the production environment
- [ ] Address any last-minute issues or bugs
- [ ] Launch the containerized application

## Next Steps
1. Build and run the containerized application using docker-compose
2. Test all components in the containerized environment
3. Address any issues that arise during testing
4. Prepare for production deployment
5. Update documentation to reflect the containerized setup
6. Plan for monitoring and logging in the containerized environment

Note: The application is now containerized with Docker. The frontend runs on port 3081, the backend on port 8081, and the database on port 5432. This setup should be considered when performing tests and maintenance.
