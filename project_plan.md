- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize API response times
- [ ] Implement efficient error handling and logging
- [ ] Optimize frontend rendering and state management
- [ ] Conduct load testing and optimize for concurrent users

## Next Steps
1. Begin performance optimization for real-time interactions
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize API response times, especially for chat and voice processing
   - Implement efficient caching mechanisms
2. Conduct load testing to ensure the application can handle expected traffic
3. Review and update error handling and logging mechanisms
4. Begin testing the containerized application with all new features
5. Update documentation to reflect the new multi-language chatbot functionality and performance optimizations
6. Prepare for production deployment with enhanced security measures
7. Plan for monitoring and logging in the containerized environment, including auth, payment-related events, and chatbot interactions
8. Conduct final security checks
9. Prepare for user training and support during the transition to the new system
